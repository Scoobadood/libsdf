# libSDF
libSDF is a library providing a CUDA based implementation of a signed distance fucntion as described in Curless & Levoy.

It provides methods for merging depth maps and for extracting the resultant 3D mesh or for raycasting it to an image buffer.

The code is not tremendously optimised and there is definitely scope for imporvement.
